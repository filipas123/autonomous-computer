# Time to build your own Personal AI Computer

## The future of AI is local

AI in 2026 looks like computing in 1975: the intelligence lives in a few mainframes, owned by a few companies, and you rent it by the token. Everyone knows how that movie ends. The machine moves onto the desk — and the people who own their machines build everything that comes next.

The Personal AI Computer is that machine. The models are good, the GPUs are affordable, and homes and businesses are reaching the same answer: bring it in-house. Three reasons:

1. **No one can switch you off.** In June 2026 the US government took Fable 5 offline for most of a month and gated GPT-5.6 behind an approved-partner list. Weights on your own disk can't be revoked.
2. **Your business is their training data.** Every prompt you send OpenAI or Anthropic carries your product, your process, your edge. They will turn your secret sauce into their product.
3. **Inference becomes free.** Open weights on a cloud API already cut the bill 20–30×. On your own machine there is no bill at all. No API, no meter.

## The end-to-end open-source local AI stack

Open software lets you run and shape your AI; open hardware lets you build, repair, and improve the machine it runs on. With both in your hands — the code, the CAD, the BOM, the BIOS settings — you can build the whole thing end to end. So we open-source both:

- **Hardware — this repo.** Your Personal AI Computer in four sizes, below: every part, every bracket, every BIOS setting, every assembly photo.
- **Software — your choice.** Run any local AI framework — vLLM, Ollama, llama.cpp — or [Grid](https://github.com/autonomous-ai/autonomous-grid), our local AI orchestrator.

## 2× NVIDIA RTX 5090

The entry-level build, for personal use. Enough for Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek with quantization — run OpenClaw, Hermes Agent, or your own LangChain stack locally.

## 8× NVIDIA RTX 5090

The on-prem build, for business. Develop, serve, and fine-tune with open models — the work that should never leave your floor.

## Software

1. **[BIOS tuning and GPU testing](setup.md)** — multi-GPU BIOS settings, NVIDIA drivers, and confirming every GPU is detected, linked at full PCIe width, and stable under load.

   <a href="setup.md"><img src="media/gpu-testing.webp" alt="nvtop showing every GPU enumerated, next to the 8× build"></a>

2. **[Run Grid](https://github.com/autonomous-ai/autonomous-grid)** — Grid is our open-source orchestration layer for local AI: it pools the computers you already own — this rig, your Mac, the workstation in the corner — behind **one OpenAI-compatible endpoint** and routes each request to whichever machine is running the right model, on your local network or remotely.

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://grid.autonomous.ai/install.sh | bash
   ```
