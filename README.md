<b><i>Own your intelligence.</i></b><br>
Open-source guides to build a machine that runs open models on hardware <b>no one can switch off</b> — every part, every bracket, every BIOS setting, every assembly photo. Pick the size that fits your budget and your work.

> **Why this exists.** The best models live in someone else's cloud, behind someone else's terms and someone else's government. A model you rent can be cut off overnight. A model running in your own house can't. Build it once; own it for good.

## Pick your configuration

One Personal AI Computer, three configurations — from a home rig to an on-prem business cluster. Each is a complete, self-contained guide: bill of materials, 3D-printable/CNC housing files, wiring, BIOS, and assembly photos.

| Config | GPUs | VRAM | Best for | Platform | Guide |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **2×** | 2× RTX 5090 | 64 GB | **Home** — your first local rig, runs a real model tonight | Intel Xeon W5 · ASUS W790 | [→ 2× config](builds/2x/README.md) |
| **4×** | 4× RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell | 384 GB | **Team** — big models + agents running all day | AMD EPYC 9124 · ASRock Rack | [→ 4× config](builds/4x/README.md) |
| **8×** | 8× RTX 4090 / 5090 | 192–256 GB | **On-prem business** — a company's AI on its own floor; IP and data never leave | Dual AMD EPYC 9004 (Genoa) | [→ 8× config](builds/8x/README.md) |

## What it can run

VRAM is the constraint that decides which open models fit. Rough guide (exact fit depends on quantization — model specifics live in [`/software`](software/README.md)):

| Build | VRAM | Open models it can serve (e.g.) |
|---|---|---|
| 2× RTX 5090 | 64 GB | Llama 70B / Qwen 72B (quantized), 30B-class at full precision, coding + agent models |
| 4× RTX PRO 6000 | 384 GB | DeepSeek-V3 / R1, Qwen 235B, Llama 405B (quantized) — frontier-class open weights |
| 8× RTX 4090/5090 | 192–256 GB | Multiple large models served at once, plus headroom for fine-tuning |

## Quick start

1. **Pick a configuration** above by budget and the models you want to run.
2. **Source the parts** from that config's Bill of Materials.
3. **Make the housing** — print the STL files or CNC the STEP files in that config's folder.
4. **Assemble** — follow the config's photo-by-photo assembly guide.
5. **Set up the software** — drivers, BIOS, and serving open models locally: [`/software`](software/README.md).
6. **Run your intelligence** — point your agent at `localhost` and never get cut off again.

## The configurations

- [**2× — Home**](builds/2x/README.md) · 2× RTX 5090, 64 GB
- [**4× — Team**](builds/4x/README.md) · 4× RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell, 384 GB
- [**8× — On-prem business**](builds/8x/README.md) · 8× RTX 4090/5090, 192–256 GB

## Software

Bringing the box to life — OS, NVIDIA drivers, BIOS tuning, serving open models (Ollama / vLLM / llama.cpp), and connecting an agent: [**`/software`**](software/README.md). *(Setup and testing are documented today; local model-serving guides are in progress.)*
