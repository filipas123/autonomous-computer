## The future of AI is local

AI in 2026 looks like computing in 1975: the intelligence lives in a few mainframes, owned by a few companies, and you rent it by the token. Everyone knows how that movie ends. The machine moves onto the desk — and the people who own their machines build everything that comes next.

The Personal AI Computer is that machine. The models are good, the GPUs are affordable, and homes and businesses are reaching the same answer: bring it in-house. Three reasons:

1. **No one can switch you off.** In June 2026 the US government took Fable 5 offline for most of a month and gated GPT-5.6 behind an approved-partner list. Weights on your own disk can't be revoked.
2. **Your business is their training data.** Every prompt you send OpenAI or Anthropic carries your product, your process, your edge. They will turn your secret sauce into their product.
3. **Inference becomes free.** Open weights on a cloud API already cut the bill 20–30×. On your own machine there is no bill at all. No API, no meter.

## The end-to-end open-source local AI stack

Most "open" AI stops at the software — the machine it runs on is still a black box you can't inspect, repair, or rebuild. If any layer is closed, that layer is where your ownership ends. So we open-source the whole stack — the hardware and the software:

- **Hardware — this repo.** Your Personal AI Computer in four sizes, below: every part, every bracket, every BIOS setting, every assembly photo.
- **Software — your choice.** Run any local AI framework — vLLM, Ollama, llama.cpp — or [Grid](https://github.com/autonomous-ai/autonomous-grid), our local AI orchestrator.

## 2× NVIDIA RTX 5090 — Home

2× RTX 5090. Enough for Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek with quantization. Run OpenClaw, Hermes Agent, or your own LangChain stack locally.

## Software

1. **[BIOS tuning and GPU testing](setup.md)** — multi-GPU BIOS settings, NVIDIA drivers, and confirming every GPU is detected, linked at full PCIe width, and stable under load.

   <a href="setup.md"><img src="media/gpu-testing.webp" alt="nvtop showing every GPU enumerated, next to the 8× build"></a>

2. **[Run Grid](https://github.com/autonomous-ai/autonomous-grid)** — Grid is our open-source orchestration layer for local AI: it pools the computers you already own — this rig, your Mac, the workstation in the corner — behind **one OpenAI-compatible endpoint** and routes each request to whichever machine is running the right model, on your local network or remotely.

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://grid.autonomous.ai/install.sh | bash
   ```
