# Build your own Personal AI Computer

Three things happened in the last month that make the case better than we ever could.

**1. Rented intelligence got switched off.** On June 12, 2026 — three days after launch — a US export-control directive [took Anthropic's Fable 5 and Mythos 5 offline](https://www.anthropic.com/news/fable-mythos-access) for every customer on earth, for most of a month. Two weeks later, [GPT-5.6 launched locked to a government-approved partner list](https://techcrunch.com/2026/06/26/openai-limits-gpt-5-6-rollout-after-government-request-says-restrictions-shouldnt-be-the-norm/). Access came back in July; the precedent stays. A model in someone else's cloud lives behind someone else's terms and someone else's government. Weights on your own disk can't be recalled.

**2. Your prompts are their training signal.** Palantir's Alex Karp [said it plainly on CNBC on July 1](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2026/07/01/palantir-ceo-alex-karp-says-something-has-gone-completely-wrong-with-how-ai-is-sold.html): enterprises are "paying for tokens that create no value" while "they're going to get my IP" — his customers "want to know they own the means of production, and it's not being transferred to someone else." Every prompt you send a frontier API describes your product, your process, your edge. Run the model in your own house and the secret sauce stays in the house.

**3. Open weights are now the cheap option, not the compromise.** [Chamath Palihapitiya's math](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/tech/26/06/53048494/chamath-palihapitiya-says-companies-are-overspending-on-ai-as-cheaper-models-rapidly-close-the-gap-burning-through-massive-budgets) for a company pushing 1B tokens in and 1B out per month: ~$105,000 on GPT-5.5 Pro, ~$30,000 on Claude Opus 4.8, ~$2,700–5,200 on DeepSeek — "the capability gap between the best open-weight models and the best closed models has narrowed much faster than the pricing gap." Companies are acting on it: [Lindy switched from Anthropic to DeepSeek and saved millions](https://restofworld.org/2026/when-americans-choose-chinese-ai/); on Vercel, DeepSeek went from under 1% to 17% of token usage in a single month. A machine from this repo is a one-time cost; after that, inference is electricity.

So we open-sourced the whole stack. **The hardware** is this repo: guides to build your own Personal AI Computer — every part, every bracket, every BIOS setting, every assembly photo, in three sizes from a desk-side box to an office rack. **The software** is [Grid](https://github.com/autonomous-ai/autonomous-grid): open-source orchestration that pools your machines behind one OpenAI-compatible endpoint and routes each request to the right model. Pick the size that fits your budget and your work. **Build it once; own it for good.**

## Quick start

1. **Pick a build** below by budget and the models you want to run — [2×](2x/README.md) · [4×](4x/README.md) · [8×](8x/README.md).
2. **Source the parts** from that build's Bill of Materials — [2×](2x/bom/bom.md) · [4×](4x/bom/bom.md) · [8×](8x/bom/bom.md).
3. **Make the housing** — print the STL files or CNC the STEP files — [2×](2x/stl-models) · [8×](8x/step_models). (The 4× uses an off-the-shelf 5U chassis.)
4. **Assemble** — follow the photo-by-photo assembly guide — [2×](2x/docs/assembly.md) · [4×](4x/docs/assembly.md) · [8×](8x/docs/assembly.md).
5. **Software** — [BIOS setup](setup.md), [GPU testing](testing.md), and [Grid](https://github.com/autonomous-ai/autonomous-grid).

## Hardware: Pick your build

There's a build for every budget and use case. Each is a complete, self-contained guide: bill of materials, housing files, wiring, BIOS, and assembly photos.

|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| [**2× — Home**](2x/README.md) | 2× RTX 5090 | 64 GB | Intel Xeon W5 (ASUS W790 ACE) | 1× 1600 W | 3D-print or CNC it yourself |
| [**4× — Team**](4x/README.md) | 4× RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell | 384 GB | AMD EPYC 9124 (ASRock Rack TURIN2D24G-2L+) | 3× 2000 W | Off-the-shelf 5U chassis |
| [**8× — On-prem business**](8x/README.md) | 8× RTX 4090 / 5090 | 192–256 GB | 2× AMD EPYC 9004 (ASRock Rack GENOA2D24G-2L+) | 4× 2000 W | CNC-milled anodized aluminum |

## Software

1. **[Setup](setup.md)** — BIOS tuning for multi-GPU, NVIDIA drivers, and your OS.
2. **[Testing](testing.md)** — confirm every GPU is detected, linked at full PCIe width, and stable under load.
3. **[Run Grid](https://github.com/autonomous-ai/autonomous-grid)** — Grid is our open-source orchestration layer for local AI: it pools the computers you already own — this rig, your Mac, the workstation in the corner — behind **one OpenAI-compatible endpoint** and routes each request to whichever machine is running the right model, on your local network or remotely.

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://grid.autonomous.ai/install.sh | bash
   ```
