# Build your own Personal AI Computer

The best models live in someone else's cloud, behind someone else's terms and someone else's government — a model you rent can be cut off overnight; a model in your own house can't. These are open-source guides to build that machine: every part, every bracket, every BIOS setting, every assembly photo. Pick the size that fits your budget and your work. **Build it once; own it for good.**

## Quick start

1. **Pick a build** below by budget and the models you want to run — [2×](2x/README.md) · [4×](4x/README.md) · [8×](8x/README.md).
2. **Source the parts** from that build's Bill of Materials — [2×](2x/bom/bom.md) · [4×](4x/bom/bom.md) · [8×](8x/bom/bom.md).
3. **Make the housing** — print the STL files or CNC the STEP files — [2×](2x/stl-models) · [8×](8x/step_models). (The 4× uses an off-the-shelf 5U chassis.)
4. **Assemble** — follow the photo-by-photo assembly guide — [2×](2x/docs/assembly.md) · [4×](4x/docs/assembly.md) · [8×](8x/docs/assembly.md).
5. **Software** — [BIOS setup](setup.md), [GPU testing](testing.md), and [Grid](https://github.com/autonomous-ai/autonomous-grid).

## Hardware: Pick your build

There's a build for every budget and use case. Each is a complete, self-contained guide: bill of materials, housing files, wiring, BIOS, and assembly photos.

| Build | GPUs | VRAM | Platform | Power | Housing |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| [**2× — Home**](2x/README.md) | 2× RTX 5090 | 64 GB | Intel Xeon W5 (ASUS W790 ACE) | 1× 1600 W | 3D-print or CNC it yourself |
| [**4× — Team**](4x/README.md) | 4× RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell | 384 GB | AMD EPYC 9124 (ASRock Rack TURIN2D24G-2L+) | 3× 2000 W | Off-the-shelf 5U chassis |
| [**8× — On-prem business**](8x/README.md) | 8× RTX 4090 / 5090 | 192–256 GB | 2× AMD EPYC 9004 (ASRock Rack GENOA2D24G-2L+) | 4× 2000 W | CNC-milled anodized aluminum |

## Software

1. **[Setup](setup.md)** — BIOS tuning for multi-GPU, NVIDIA drivers, and your OS.
2. **[Testing](testing.md)** — confirm every GPU is detected, linked at full PCIe width, and stable under load.
3. **[Run Grid](https://github.com/autonomous-ai/autonomous-grid)** — Grid is our open-source orchestration layer for local AI: it pools the computers you already own — this rig, your Mac, the workstation in the corner — behind **one OpenAI-compatible endpoint** and routes each request to whichever machine is running the right model, on your local network or remotely.

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://grid.autonomous.ai/install.sh | bash
   ```
