The largest build: eight GPUs on a dual-EPYC (Genoa) platform in a CNC-milled, anodized aluminum housing. A team's AI on your own floor, where your IP and data never leave the building.

| GPUs | VRAM | Platform | Memory | Power |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 8× NVIDIA RTX 4090 or 5090 | 192–256 GB | 2× AMD EPYC 9004 (Genoa) on ASRock Rack GENOA2D24G-2L+ | DDR5 ECC (up to 24 DIMMs) | 4× PSU, 8000 W total |

## Build it

1. **Parts** — the [bill of materials](bom/bom.md).
2. **Housing** — CNC the [STEP files](step_models) (STL versions in [stl-models](stl-models)), then sand-blast and anodize — the [housing guide](docs/prepare-me.md) shows the process.
3. **Lay out the electronics** — the [component checklist](docs/prepare-ee.md), with a photo of every part.
4. **Assemble** — the [photo-by-photo assembly guide](docs/assembly.md), 39 steps from bare plates to a running machine.
5. **BIOS, drivers, testing** — the shared [setup](../setup.md) and [testing](../testing.md) guides. Board-specific notes below.

## BIOS notes for this board

The GENOA2D24G-2L+ feeds the GPUs over MCIO, so link width is the setting that matters most (see the general list in [setup](../setup.md)):

```
Advanced -> Chipset Configuration -> PCIE link width
  -> set MCIO2/1, MCIO4/3, MCIO6/5, MCIO8/7, MCIO12/11, MCIO14/13, MCIO16/15, MCIO18/17 to x16
Advanced -> PCI Subsystems Settings -> Enable Re-size BAR support
```

Above 4G Decoding is typically enabled by default on this platform — verify it.

## Testing

All eight cards detected, full VRAM, full PCIe width — the checklist is in [testing](../testing.md).

## Other builds

Smaller footprint? The [2× Home build](../2x/README.md) (2× RTX 5090, start tonight) and the [4× Team build](../4x/README.md) (4× RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell, 384 GB VRAM) use the same playbook.
